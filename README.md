I Very misguided attempt and making an ent com system where every com would be serialized into a json file and the game is completely defined in json files. 

## Compiling
Open the ```.sln``` file and run.

## Running 
Run in visual studio

## How does anything work?
Under the folder ```Minigames``` you will find a bunch of ```.json``` the names of the files are self explanatory. In each file it will define a list of ents with each ent having a list of Components now these Components fields are defined entirely in the json. This whole thing is very strange and Honestly I don't really remember how it works it was overly complicated when I made it and it's a miracle it works at all.
